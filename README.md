# PROJECT BUSINESS CASE

## Description of the Project
In this project, I will employ some of the Power BI and Python skills I have learned to construct a series of related reports and a dashboard from a single data source. <br>
I will be using visualizations to create reports that will provide insight about our dataset, including conversion rate, customer retention rate


## Description of the dataset
The Gapminder dataset SampleDataWS combines data from multiple sources into coherent time-series information about life expectancy over time for countries and regions around the world.
