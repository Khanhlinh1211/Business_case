# PROJECT BUSINESS CASE

## Description of the Project
In this project, I will employ some of the Power BI and Python skills I have learned to construct a series of related reports and a dashboard from a single data source. I will be using visualizations to create reports that will provide insight about our dataset.<br>

# Detailed Project Report
In this report, I've gone into great depth on the data processing and analysis stages. Additionally, after visualizing the criteria, comments are given to help with problem-solving for each department. <br>
